Student tutor Tutorial management System
The Student Tutor Management System is a project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
It aims to provide a platform for managing student-tutor relationships and tutorials. The system incorporates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing students, tutors, and tutorials.

On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create an interactive user interface. 
The user can perform various actions such as adding new students or tutors, updating their information, deleting entries, and viewing the details of tutorials.
The frontend utilizes the Fetch API to establish communication with the backend.

For the backend, Node.js and Express.js are employed to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
The backend receives requests from the frontend and processes them accordingly.
It uses the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data related to students, tutors, and tutorials.
The backend also incorporates Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) as middleware to enable secure communication between the frontend and backend.

In summary, the Student Tutor Management System provides a user-friendly interface for managing student-tutor relationships and tutorials.
It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. 
CRUD operations are implemented to perform actions such as adding, updating, and deleting students, tutors, and tutorials.
The system ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend using the Fetch API and CORS middleware.
